# House Robber

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and  **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return  *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight  **without alerting the police***.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int prev2 = 0; // Best total up to 2 houses back
        int prev1 = 0; // Best total up to 1 house back

        for (int num : nums) {
            // Compare robbing this house vs. skipping this house
            int current = Math.max(prev2 + num, prev1);
            
            // Move our pointers forward for the next house
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        return prev1; // Final answer after checking all houses
    }
}
```
